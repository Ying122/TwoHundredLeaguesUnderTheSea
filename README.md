# TwoHundredLeaguesUnderTheSea


The work reflects on survival in a human-altered environment. The title is taken from French author Jule Verneâ€™s 1840 science-fiction novel, in which he wrote about an exciting adventure in the underwater world. Two hundred years later, our relationship with the underwater world has gone far beyond what he had imagined. Our seemingly unimportant daily decisions, which prioritize convenience over sustainability, threaten the survival of the underwater creatures, since most of our plastic waste eventually ends up in the ocean. The work aims to illuminate the severity of the seemingly innocuous actions of the audience by forcing them to see the suffering creature.
